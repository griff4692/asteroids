## Summary description

A browser game inspired by the classic arcade game written in JavaScript.  It is a fun interactive game with points, levels of increasing difficulty, and lives / bonus lives.

## Features:

- Dynamic graphics drawn using Canvas HTML5
- Smooth UI including bullet recoil, velocity drag, user-initiated acceleration, leveraging keymaster.js
- Each level increases in difficulty via a higher initial asteroid count and steadily increasing spawn rate
- Asteroids move differently according to size
- Simple but highly legible CSS styling

## Features To Add:

- Draw objects using Sprites rather than canvas lines / arcs
- Create a leaderboard
- Marry bullet speed to ship's speed
- Introduce additional objects such as 'flying saucers'
