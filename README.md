A browser game inspired by the classic arcade game written in JavaScript.

Existing Features
- Dynamic graphics drawn using Canvas HTML5
- Fun, interactive game display with points, levels, and extra lives
- Smooth UI including bullet recoil, velocity drag, leveraging keymaster.js
- Each level increases in difficulty via a higher initial asteroid count and steadily increasing spawn rate
- Asteroids move differently according to size
- Simple but highly legible CSS styling

Features To Implement
- Draw objects using Sprites rather than canvas lines / arcs
- Create a leaderboard
- Marry bullet speed to ship's speed
- Introduce additional objects such as 'flying saucers'
